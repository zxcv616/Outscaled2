# Autocomplete Status - Docker Setup

## Current Status âœ…

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed React Key Warning**: Properly destructured key from Material-UI props
2. **Backend Optimizations**: Added player cache + player details cache
3. **Docker Rebuild**: Containers rebuilt with optimizations
4. **API Endpoint**: Corrected to use Docker backend (port 8000)

### Docker Containers Running:
- **Backend**: `outscaled2-backend-1` on port 8000
- **Frontend**: `outscaled2-frontend-1` on port 3000
- **Status**: Both containers UP and running

### Backend Loading Progress:
- âœ… Data loading: 1,083,660 records from 2014-2025
- âœ… Player cache: 11,443 players
- ðŸ”„ Player details cache: Currently building (this improves /player-details performance)

## Testing Instructions:

### Manual Test (Recommended):
1. **Open Browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. **Find Player Field**: Look for "Player Names" autocomplete field
3. **Test Typing**: 
   - Type any letter â†’ Should see "Searching players..." immediately
   - Type "faker" â†’ Should find "Faker" quickly
   - Type "caps" â†’ Should find "Caps" and related players

### Expected Behavior:
- **Immediate Feedback**: Loading indicator appears instantly when typing
- **Fast Results**: Search results under 50ms once backend is ready
- **Real Data**: No test players, only real professional players
- **No React Warnings**: Key prop warning should be gone

## Docker Development Notes:

### Volume Mounting:
Your docker-compose.yml has:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./backend:/app
  - ./frontend:/app
```

This means:
- **Code changes** should hot-reload without rebuild
- **Package changes** require rebuild
- **Dockerfile changes** require rebuild

### Quick Development Cycle:
1. **Code changes**: Just save and wait for hot reload
2. **New packages**: `docker-compose up --build`
3. **Debug**: `docker-compose logs backend` or `docker-compose logs frontend`

## Current Issue:
Backend is still building player details cache. Once complete, all endpoints should respond quickly.

## Next Steps:
1. Wait for backend to fully load (should see "Data loaded successfully" in logs)
2. Test autocomplete in browser at http://localhost:3000
3. Verify no React warnings in browser console
4. Test different player searches (faker, caps, mata, etc.)

The optimizations are in place and should provide the fast, responsive autocomplete experience once the backend finishes its initial data processing.
