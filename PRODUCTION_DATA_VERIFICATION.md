- ‚úÖ **position, date, year** - Context
- ‚úÖ **Advanced metrics**: DPM, GPM, vision score, CS, etc.

### Sample Data Validation ‚úÖ
Real production examples:
```
Faker (LCK): 544 games, position: mid, kills: [0,6,3,0,4,2,2,0,5,1]
Sample teams: T1, SK Telecom T1, Bilibili Gaming, EDward Gaming
Sample leagues: LCK, LPL, LEC, LCS, MSI, Worlds
```
