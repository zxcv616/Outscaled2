# Confidence Calculation Consistency Fix

## Problem Summary

The confidence scores were inconsistent between the main prediction and the prediction curve for the same prop value. This was caused by:

1. **Different tier information sources**: The `predict()` method got tier info from `sample_details`, while `generate_prediction_curve()` got it from `features`
2. **Circular dependency**: The expected stat calculation used model confidence, which then affected the final confidence calculation
3. **Duplicated logic**: Confidence calculation logic was duplicated in multiple places

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Centralized Confidence Calculation

Created a new `_calculate_confidence()` method that handles all confidence calculations consistently:

```python
def _calculate_confidence(self, features: Dict[str, float], prop_value: float, 
                         expected_stat: float, sample_details: Dict = None) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Centralized confidence calculation to ensure consistency across all methods"""
```

This method:
- Gets calibrated probabilities from the model
- Calculates gap-based confidence adjustment
- Applies tier weighting consistently
- Returns all confidence components

### 2. Removed Circular Dependency

Updated `_calculate_expected_stat()` to calculate expected statistics based purely on empirical data:
- Removed model confidence from the calculation
- Now uses only historical average, form, volatility, and position factors
- Prevents circular dependency where confidence affects expected stat which affects confidence

### 3. Updated Both Prediction Methods

Both `predict()` and `generate_prediction_curve()` now use the centralized confidence calculation:
- Ensures identical confidence values for the same inputs
- Consistent tier information handling
- Same gap-based adjustment logic

## Test Results

Created `test_confidence_consistency.py` to validate the fix:

```
Test: Low Prop (High Gap) (Prop: 1.0)
  Main Confidence: 78.0%
  Curve Confidence: 78.0%
  Status: CONSISTENT

Test: Medium Prop (Medium Gap) (Prop: 2.5)
  Main Confidence: 78.0%
  Curve Confidence: 78.0%
  Status: CONSISTENT

Test: High Prop (Low Gap) (Prop: 3.5)
  Main Confidence: 67.6%
  Curve Confidence: 67.6%
  Status: CONSISTENT

Test: Very High Prop (UNDER prediction) (Prop: 5.0)
  Main Confidence: 69.3%
  Curve Confidence: 69.3%
  Status: CONSISTENT
```

## Benefits

1. **100% Consistency**: Confidence values are now identical between all prediction methods
2. **Better Logic**: Removed circular dependency makes the model more predictable
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for confidence calculation
4. **Correct Behavior**: Confidence properly reflects the gap between expected stat and prop value
