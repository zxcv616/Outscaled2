BETTING LOGIC VALIDATION TESTS

These tests validate the core betting terminology fixes that distinguish
between COMBINED statistics (Maps 1-2 = total across both maps) vs 
AVERAGE statistics (Maps 1-2 = average per map).

CRITICAL BETTING LOGIC:
======================
When betting markets say "Maps 1-2 Kills 8.5", they mean:
- COMBINED kills across Map 1 + Map 2 
- NOT average kills per map in that range

BEFORE FIXES: System calculated averages (incorrect)
AFTER FIXES: System should calculate combined totals (correct)

VALIDATION AREAS:
================
1. Combined statistics calculation vs simple averages
2. Series-based feature extraction (grouping by match_series)
3. Historical combined performance analysis
4. Prop value generation using combined logic
5. Expected stat calculation using combined methodology
6. Training data generation using series outcomes

These tests will FAIL before fixes and PASS after fixes are implemented.
