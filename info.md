🔍 Frontend Enhancements for Prediction View (Quant-Grade)
As a Senior Quantitative Analyst, here’s a set of actionable UI/UX and data enhancements to elevate your prediction interface for League of Legends props — targeting pro user trust, transparency, and decision-making.

1. 🧠 Prop Value Deviation Metrics
Why: Sophisticated users care about statistical distance, not just raw expected values.
