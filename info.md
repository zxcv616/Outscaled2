The frontend prediction view appears to be out of sync with the updated backend model logic. Fields such as confidenceMethod still show "gamma_bootstrap" despite the backend using bootstrap_percentile or temporal calibration methods. The position_factor is also appearing in the top feature drivers list, even though static role-based multipliers have been removed from the model and feature set. Additional inconsistencies likely include outdated or missing fields such as patch_group, temporalCalibration.needsRetraining, accurate dataTier or tierUsed labels, and sample quality indicators (data_quality). Confidence intervals may also still reflect legacy gamma-based logic rather than bootstrap percentiles. Feature importance mappings should reflect the current drivers like recent_z_score or market_distance, not deprecated features. The frontend should be updated to reflect the latest backend schema and dynamic logic, including patch-aware tiering, real-time calibration metadata, and volatility-safe confidence intervals.
